# Udacity Neighborhood Map Project

This is my implementation of the Udacity Neighborhood project. 

You can start the project by simply opening the mapsapplication.html file in the root folder. Make sure you have an active internet connection for the app to work. 

The map will show you some of my favorite restaurant locations in Stockholm, including a link to the foursquare page. You can filter the locations by entering a string in the input field to the site. Enjoy!
